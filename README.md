# The IQ Series

![The IQ Series Banner](./images/iq-series-banner.png)

Master Microsoft IQ with The IQ Series! Microsoft IQ is Microsoft's unified intelligence layer for the enterprise, bringing together three core intelligence services:

- **Foundry IQ**: A managed knowledge layer for enterprise data; connecting structured and unstructured data across Azure, SharePoint, OneLake, and the web so agents can access permission-aware knowledge.
- **Work IQ**: The intelligence layer that personalizes Microsoft 365 Copilot; understanding context, relationships, and work patterns so agents can be faster, more accurate, and more secure.
- **Fabric IQ**: Unify business semantics across data, models, and systems to power intelligent agents and decisions grounded in a live, holistic view of the business.

Together, these IQs enable AI agents to reason, retrieve, and act with deep business context going beyond traditional RAG for true enterprise intelligence.

> **Note:** The series kicks off with **Foundry IQ** episodes. Work IQ and Fabric IQ content is coming soon!

📺 Foundry IQ episodes premiere **every Wednesday at 9 AM PT**, starting **March 18, 2026** on [Microsoft Developer YouTube](https://aka.ms/iq-series).

### Episode Format

Each episode includes:

- **Introduction (1 min)**: Executive speech
- **Tech Talk (15 min)**: Interactive discussion with Product Group + Advocacy
- **Close-out (1 min)**: Doodle summary

Episode folders also include Jupyter notebook cookbooks with hands-on, step-by-step guidance.

## 🚀 Get Started

### 1. Deploy to Azure

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://aka.ms/iq-series/deploytoazure)

Click the button above to deploy all required Azure resources — AI Search, Azure OpenAI, a Foundry project, and seeded sample data with a ready-to-use knowledge base.

In the deployment form:

- **Create a new resource group** (e.g., `iq-series-rg`) — click **Create new** under the Resource group field
- Enter your **User Object ID** — run the following in a terminal to get it:

```bash
az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv
```

- Customize the resource prefix, location, and SKUs as needed, then click **Review + create**

Once deployment completes, copy the **Azure AI Search endpoint** from the deployment **Outputs** tab — you'll need it in the next step.

### 2. Learn with Copilot

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://aka.ms/iq-series/learnwithcopilot)

Launch a Codespace and start exploring Foundry IQ with GitHub Copilot. Copilot connects to your deployed knowledge base via MCP — ask it questions about your data and get grounded, cited answers.

1. Click the button above to open a Codespace
2. Open **Copilot Chat**, click the **🔧 Tools** icon, find **foundry-iq**, and click **Start** — you'll be prompted to enter your **Azure AI Search endpoint** from the deployment Outputs tab
3. Open any cookbook notebook and use Copilot to help you learn and experiment

You can also use this locally — clone the repo and open in VS Code. The MCP config loads automatically. For Copilot CLI, add the server with `/mcp add` or edit `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`.
